Here are the links to my origional data sets that I looked at:

[Reported Voting and Registration, by Sex and Single Years of Age: November 2020](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/p20/585/table01.xlsx)
[Black Alone](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/p20/585/table02_4.xlsx)

To clean this data, I got rid of a lot of the headings and extra columns that were not needed. I then had to simplify the lables so that the chart was usable. I realized that I really wanted to suppliment the data that I found with more data, so I found another chart that would go along with it. I did the same thing to this chart.

The question I attempted to answer was, out of the young voters 18-24, how many of those voters where black females? In actually executing this story, I would like to determine this number for multiple groups of voters, but this felt like a good place to start.

I'm not quite sure I successfully answered this question yet. I will update this when I figure it out. 

A question that I DID answer was: Which group of black voters showed the most turnout?
The answer to that was females 65 to 74. The group that voted the least was males 18-25.
