# Critique on Airbnb Snowballs in Vermont Ski Towns, Bringing Cash and Concerns 

## Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate?
  * 3/5 - No. There were several statistics at the beginning of the article, but they were not the main point of the article. The author took quite a few grafs to get to the main point.
* What was the main point?  
  * The main point of the article was that AirBnB is growing in this ski town, which is causing problems for residents because big corperations are buying all the affordable properties and turning them into AirBnBs.
* Was there data visualization? 
  * There is one graphic that shows the amount of AirBnB's in a few select cities in Vermont. It is easy to read, but I am not sure if it is particularly helpful in getting across the entire point. It is important to establish this information, but it needs to be supplimented with other reporting. I would have liked to see more graphics on this piece.
* Do you think the data was accurate?
  * 4/5 - The data seems mostly accurate. The stat that 12% of Stowe's housing stock is in AirBnB is shockingly high, but I don't really have anything to compare this to. I am also not sure of the reliability of Seven Days Analysis. The other data is sourced from other places and seems accurate.
  * I would suggest that the reporter check with the federal office of Housing and Urban Development
  * The author did provide a source, which was Seven Days Analysis
  * I would say that the author explained everything that needed explaining, but they also added a lot of extra unnecessary details that made it hard to find the point of what she was saying.
## Quality

* Was it executed at a high degree/ quality
  * 3/5- I am giving it this score because it has some good things in it, but there are a lot of things going on. Some of the article talks about how big companies are buying real estate and making them AirBnB's. Then it also talks about how regular people who rent their places on AirBnB are making upwards of $2,000 during the holiday season. It is al valuable and interesting information, but the organization made it a little hard to follow.

 ## Type and Color
 * Color- 2/5I don't know much about type, but I do know a little bit about the usage of color on a graph. The graph that the author uses only uses one shade of blue for all of the blobs on his graph. It kind of makes it hard to distinguish size between blobs. It would have been helpful if the colors were on a gradient.

## Creativity
* 2/5- The only reason that I rank this so low is because I think that there was a lot of opportunity to include more visuals in this piece. Maybe they could have shown a graph that showed the change over time for the amount of AirBnB's in respective areas. They could have also gotten creative with ways to show the amount of money that people were making off of their homes. It is a shame because there is a lot of good reporting in this article, but it does not really make use of the visual elements.
