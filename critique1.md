# Critique on Airbnb Snowballs in Vermont Ski Towns, Bringing Cash and Concerns 

## Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate?
  * 3/5 - No. There were several statistics at the beginning of the article, but they were not the main point of the article. The author took quite a few grafs to get to the main point.
* What was the main point?  
  * The main point of the article was that AirBnB is growing in this ski town, which is causing problems for residents because big corperations are buying all the affordable properties and turning them into AirBnBs.
* Was there data visualization? 
  * There is one graphic that shows the amount of AirBnB's in a few select cities in Vermont. It is easy to read, but I am not sure if it is particularly helpful in getting across the entire point. It is important to establish this information, but it needs to be supplimented with other reporting. I would have liked to see more graphics on this piece.
* Do you think the data was accurate?
  * 4/5 - The data seems mostly accurate. The stat that 12% of Stowe's housing stock is in AirBnB is shockingly high, but I don't really have anything to compare this to. I am also not sure of the reliability of Seven Days Analysis. The other data is sourced from other places and seems accurate.
  * I would suggest that the reporter check with the federal office of Housing and Urban Development
  * The author did provide a source, which was Seven Days Analysis
  * I would say that the author explained everything that needed explaining, but they also added a lot of extra unnecessary details that made it hard to find the point of what she was saying.
