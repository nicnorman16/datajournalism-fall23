## Story Research

Our story will take the data found in this [New York Times/Siena Poll](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/01/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voters-crosstabs.html), how young voters (18-29) are dissatisfied with apparent front-runners President Biden and Trump, and use it to reflect on (1) the impact the youth vote has had on the outcome of previous elections and (2) what implications that holds for the upcoming 2024 presidential election. 

We will analyze the exit polls from the 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2020 presidential elections to highlight the historical significance of the youth vote, especially in elections like 2008 and 2020, when young voters greatly impacted the outcome. 

Stories have been done at the end of each election cycle analyzing the exit polls and comparing some of the data to the last presidential election, like this story from [2008](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna27525497). We believe our story will differ from what has been done before because it is comparing data sets across multiple years and specific to one demographic - youth voters. [This NBC report](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/poll-overwhelming-majorities-express-concerns-biden-trump-ahead-2024-r-rcna111347) touches slightly on what we hope to cover. It includes quotations from voters of both parties who voted in 2020 and asked them if their vote would change. One respondent said that he voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but in 2024 he would not vote for him and would rather vote for a third party candidate. Although the story did not go into much detail comparing 2020 data to 2024 data, it did compare voter interest for the 2020 election to the 2024 election. 

Interestingly enough, since 2008 the Pew Research Center has recorded an increase in youth voter turnout, most recently finding that the 2020 presidential election saw an [11% increase](https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016) of young voters from 2016. Given the [lack of enthusiasm](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_100223/) for Biden and Trump among all voters, the 2024 election may be an exception to this. 

The three (and more) datasets we could use in our story are: 
* Pew Research Polls ([2008](https://www.pewresearch.org/2008/11/13/young-voters-in-the-2008-election/), [2012](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2012/11/26/young-voters-supported-obama-less-but-may-have-mattered-more/), [2016](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2018/08/09/an-examination-of-the-2016-electorate-based-on-validated-voters/), [2020](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/)): The Pew Research Center is a trustworthy data source because it is known for its polling accuracy and is a reputable source. One of the limitations in these datasets is the fact that the 2020 election took place during a global pandemic so mail-in ballots and early voting made it easier for voter participation. Thus, the 2024 presidential election data may show lower voter turnout among various demographics given that change in circumstance. 
* [New York Times/Siena Poll](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/01/us/elections/times-siena-poll-registered-voters-crosstabs.html): This poll from the New York Times is important to our story because it includes polling on issues beyond just the candidates and highlights youth voter (18-29) dissatisfaction with national issues like the economy, foreign aid and support, abortion, LGBTQ+ rights, etc. This poll is from July 2023 meaning its data is limited and only applicable to a period before the Israel-Hamas war, speaker saga, possible government shutdown, etc. 
CIRCLE, Tufts University ([2008](https://archive.civicyouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/fs_gender_09_final1.pdf), [2012](https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/election-night-2012-half-young-people-voted-60-backed-president-obama), [2016](https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/election-night-2016-24-million-youth-voted-most-rejected-trump), [2020](https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/half-youth-voted-2020-11-point-increase-2016)): CIRCLE, the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement is a research organization focused on youth civic engagement. CIRCLE data can be useful to our story because much of its data is comparative, providing us visual datasets highlighting differences between youth voter turnout in elections, per state and per candidate. Some of the limitations with this data is that not only is CIRCLE a research organization, but it is also an advocacy group that works to promote youth civic engagement, which could add some bias to their datasets and lead them to incorporate polling data that reflects better on their civic engagement goals.
