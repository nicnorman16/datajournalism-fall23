##Clarity and accuracy

*Were you able immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate?
  *3/5 - No. There were several statistics at the beginning of the article, but they were not the main point of the article. The author took quite a few grafs to get to the main point.
*What was the main point?
  *The main point of the article was that AirBnB is growing in this ski town, which is causing problems for residents because big corperations are buying all the affordable properties and turning them into AirBnBs.
