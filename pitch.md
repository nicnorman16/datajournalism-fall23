# Young voters and the growing age of American politicians

With President Biden, former President Trump, Rep. Pelosi and other aging politicians anouncing their campaigns for re-election, there seems to be a growing frustration amoung young voters (age 18-29) about the disconnect between them and the people who represent them.

The New York Times has reported that 94% of Democrats want to see a new candidate for president in 2024. Despite this overwhelming majority, the DNC is standing firmly behind their decision to have Biden run again. Young voters are a large and importatnt electorate for Democrats, but if they are unenthused about their candidate, it may be hard to get them to come out on Election Day. The Times also reported that only 32% of Democratic voters under 30 are "almost certain" that they will vote in November. 

These numbers are incredibly interesting to me, as it seems like Democrats would want to capitalize off of midterm success. 

I would love to expand on this research to include young Republican voters. The same conversation about age does not seem to extend to Donald Trump. Why? Do they feel energized to vote for aging candidates? On top of this question, I would also like to look into the growing conversation around term limits in congress and senate. How many young voters are tuned into this coversation and what do they think of it?

Election season is around the corner and is about to start ramping up, making this research timely and relevant to the initual conversations around the 2024 election. 

The people that I could talk to for this are:

* Voters under 30 in the Democratic and Republican party
* Political scientists who speicalize in voter behavior
* Campaign press staffers for aging candidates such as Biden and Pelosi
